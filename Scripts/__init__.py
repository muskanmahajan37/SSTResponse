The Python repository "AntSeaIceVari" contains the scripts, data,
figures, and text for 2 AMIP-style simulations following the
PAMIP protocol for 100 year periods. The models are SC-WACCM4
and E3SM. We are interested in the internal variability of the 
atmospheric response to sea surface temperatures.
